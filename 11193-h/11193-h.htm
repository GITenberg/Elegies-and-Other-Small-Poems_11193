      <i>The many endearing instances of regard I have experienced
      since I had the honor of being known to your Ladyship, while
      they impress my mind with gratitude, flatter my hopes with a
      favourable reception of the following miscellanies, which,

      gratified, if, in your Ladyship's judgment, they may be

      inclination with enumerating those virtues and endowments
      which confessedly distinguish your Ladyship, but my wishes I
      may offer, and that you may long, very long, continue to

    <h2>
      TO THE READER.
    </h2>
    <p style="margin: 1em; text-indent: 1em;">
      If, in the following pages, there may be found any
      unacknowledged imitations, I hope I shall not be censured as
      an intentional plagiarist; for it has been my wish, however I
      may be esteemed presumptuous, not to be unjust; and I
      sometimes fear lest an imperfect recollection of another's
      idea should have appeared to me as a dawning thought of my
      own. Wherever I could recollect a similar passage, although
      unnoticed at the time I wrote, it has been either altered or
      acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1em; text-indent: 1em;">
      I commit these trifles to the press with the anxiety
      necessarily resulting from a desire that they may not be
      deemed altogether worthless. Though the natural partiality of
      the writer may be somewhat strengthened by the commendations
      of friends and parents, I am well aware that no apology can
      give currency to imperfection.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1em; text-indent: 1em;">
      I have not vainly attempted to ascend to the steeps of
      Parnassus. If, wandering at its foot, I have mistaken
      perishable shrubs for never-dying flowers, the errors of a
      youthful mind, first viewing the fascinating regions of
      fancy, will not be rigidly condemned; for wherever there is
      true taste, there will be genuine candour.

            His thoughts and feelings did declare,<br>
            His father would delighted hear,<br>
            Would fondly drop the grateful tear;<br>
            And proudly cast his eyes around,<br>
            But not an equal could be found.<br>
            Warm from each lip applauses broke,<br>
            And every tongue his praises spoke;<br>
            The list'ning courtiers spread his fame,<br>
            And blessings follow'd Cen'lins name.

            Now twenty summer's suns had flown,<br>
            And Mercia's hopes were fully blown;<br>
            When ah! conceal'd in coarse disguise,<br>
            To Selred's<a href="#note-12">12</a> court their
            darling flies.<br>
            Selred, his father's scorn and hate,<br>
            Became the ruler of his fate.<br>
            There flatter'd, lov'd, the youth remain'd,<br>
            Till Cenulph's threats his heir regain'd.<br>
            But ah! no more the son of mirth,<br>
            His pensive eye now sought the earth;<br>
            No more within the dance to move,<br>
            Or list to sages, did he love;<br>
            But from surrounding friends would fly,<br>
            To pour in solitude the sigh.<br>
            And soon again the youth withdrew,<br>
            Again to th' Eastern-Saxons flew.<br>
            His father heard, opprest with woe,<br>
            His aged heart forgot to glow;<br>
            He learnt his foes an army led,<br>
            With youthful Cen'lin at their head,<br>
            He call'd his warriors forth to meet,<br>
            And stretch the rebel at hit feet:<br>
            Tears from his eyes in anguish broke,<br>
            As thus the aged monarch spoke:

            &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ye Mercians, let your banners fly!<br>
            The graceless youth this day shall die!<br>
            For, since he dares an army bring<br>
            Against his father and his king,<br>
            Though dear as life, I will not spare,<br>
            Nor listen to affection's pray'r!<br>
            If all my people should implore,<br>
            I'll pardon the rash boy no more!<br>
            His harden'd heart, to duty blind,<br>
            No ties of gratitude can bind;<br>
            This hoary head would else have rest,<br>
            And pleasure warm this aching breast.<br>
            Ah, cruel youth! thy wrongs I feel,<br>
            More deep than wounds of pointed steel.<br>
            For, if forlorn the parent's doom,<br>
            Who bears his offspring to the tomb,<br>
            Some comfort still his breast may know,<br>
            Some soothing thought may calm his woe,<br>
            And when he gives a loose to pain,<br>
            He feels not that he mourns in vain,<br>
            But fancies still his darling nigh,<br>
            And grateful for each bursting sigh,<br>
            Still bending o'er, with list'ning ear,<br>
            Each weeping, fond complaint to hear,<br>
            The dear-lov'd phantom hovers round,<br>
            And pours a balm in every wound.

            "How doubly poignant is my smart,<br>
            Bereaved of my Cen'lin's heart!<br>
            Exil'd from that deluded breast,<br>
            Where I had fondly hop'd to rest,<br>
            With faith undoubting, sweet repose,<br>
            Till Death should bid my eye-lids close.<br>
            And sometimes yet will hope arise;<br>
            Till now he ever scorn'd disguise;<br>
            Some cursed fiend might taint his youth,<br>
            And warp a temper form'd for truth.<br>
            When late he humbly knelt for grace,<br>
            And clasp'd my knees in close embrace,<br>
            Upon his lips a secret hung,<br>
            But something seem'd to stay his tongue;<br>
            I prest not, for my anger slept,<br>
            And fondness only saw he wept;<br>
            Ah! fatal haste! then had I known<br>
            The serpent, I had sav'd my son!<br>
            Yet surely pardon frank as mine,<br>
            A noble heart would more confine!<br>
            When leaguing with my bitter foe,<br>
            To strike some grand, decisive blow;<br>
            Perhaps to rob me of my throne,<br>
            And make it, ere the time, his own;<br>
            Or, should wan guilt a danger dread,<br>
            To humble this devoted head,<br>
            Each throbbing pang of conscience drown,<br>
            And seize, with bloody hands, the crown.<br>
            O'er this offence I cast a veil,<br>
            And fondly hush'd the whisper'd tale.<br>
            Ah fool! deluded by the grace,<br>
            Of that fine form, and perfect face;<br>
            I thought his bosom free from sin,<br>
            Nor dreamt a demon lurk'd within.<br>
            His voice, which ever could controul,<br>
            Each passion of the hearer's soul,<br>
            With ease my partial heart beguil'd,<br>
            Who knew no sorrows when he smil'd.<br>
            And ah! my friends, your downcast eyes,<br>
            Your pensive air, and smother'd sighs,<br>
            All tell me you lament the fate,<br>
            Of him, whom yet you cannot hate.<br>
            And shall I bear then to behold,<br>
            That form inanimate and cold,<br>
            His smiling lips depriv'd of breath,<br>
            His eyes for ever clos'd in death!<br>
            Ah no! my heart with anguish swells,<br>
            And every throbbing vein rebels.<br>
            Let sorrow weep, or anger thrill,<br>
            Yet all the parent triumphs still.

            "Oh Father! who in mercy reigns,<br>
            If thy all-ruling will ordains,<br>
            That my unhappy Cen'lin dies,<br>
            Remove the picture from my eyes!<br>
            At the same moment set us free,<br>
            Both rebel sons, my God, to thee!"<br>
            Thus did the king pour forth his pray'r,<br>
            With all the wildness of despair;<br>
            Then, stilling every rising sigh,<br>
            He calm'd the anguish of his eye,<br>
            And though within the burthen lay,<br>
            He wip'd the falling tears away.

            When lo! there comes a youthful train,<br>
            Descending swiftly to the plain,<br>
            Drest like the fairest sons of day,<br>
            In floating robes and colours gay;<br>
            No crested helmets there appear,<br>
            No glittering shield or pointed spear,<br>
            But youths with honey-suckles crown'd,<br>
            Or their fair locks with fillets bound,<br>
            Whose circling ranks and varied dyes,<br>
            Shew'd like the bow, that gilds the skies.<br>
            Whilst in the van a pair were seen,<br>
            Of peerless charms and graceful mien;<br>
            One lovely form the Mercians knew,<br>
            And gladden'd at the pleasing view,<br>
            Who, with the glow of youthful prime,<br>
            Had all the majesty of time.<br>
            And beauteous was the fair he led,<br>
            As any fabled Grecian maid;<br>
            The nymphs who tend Aurora's car,<br>
            And usher in the morning star,<br>
            Though made inhabitants of air,<br>
            Were not more elegant and fair;<br>
            Nor Dian's ever-healthful train,<br>
            When skimming o'er the spacious plain.<br>
            Had not more pure, more lively dyes,<br>
            Or brighter lustre in their eyes.

            &nbsp;

          <p>
            The king, so late by woe deprest,<br>
            Felt hope reanimate his breast,<br>
            And as his Cen'lin nearer drew,<br>
            His waking hopes more vivid grew.<br>
            "My friends," he cried, "will you believe,<br>
            That open mien can e'er deceive?<br>
            That blooming, form can e'er unfold,<br>
            A heart ungenerous and cold,<br>
            That melting softness of the eye,<br>
            Can harbour direst cruelty?<br>
            Ah no! a poison's baleful pow'r,<br>
            Lurks not beneath so fair a flow'r.<br>
            Nor are those youths with amber hair,<br>
            Such as fell treason would prepare,<br>
            An aged monarch to dethrone,<br>
            And hear, unmov'd, a father's groan.<br>
            Gay are their looks, no dark disguise,<br>
            Dims the mild radiance of their eyes;<br>
            No murderous thoughts their souls employ,<br>
            But, heralds of transporting joy,<br>
            They come to bid suspicion cease,<br>
            And sooth my sorrow into peace."<br>
            Caution could scarce awhile controul<br>
            The strong delights of Cenulph's soul,<br>
            When Cen'lin knelt, and by his side<br>
            Half-kneeling, bent his lovely bride.<br>
            But, when he first essay'd to speak,<br>
            A hasty blush pass'd o'er his cheek,<br>
            He hung awhile his graceful head,<br>
            Till thus, with air confus'd he said:<br>
            "I come, by love with honours crown'd,<br>
            Yet sorrow casts a shade around,<br>
            That when my consort here I bring,<br>
            The heiress of a potent king,<br>
            The Mercians, clad in armour, come,<br>
            To lead their princess to her home.<br>
            No joyful hail our nuptial greets,<br>
            No proof of love my Ela meets,<br>
            But scarlet banners, waving high,<br>
            The bridal knot and wreath supply.<br>
            Alas! I see mistrust has won<br>
            E'en Cenulph's fondness from his son;<br>
            Or could my ever-honour'd sire,<br>
            A proof of Cen'lin's faith require?<br>
            Can force so needful now appear,<br>
            To aid a pow'r which I revere?<br>
            When eager beauty's form to view,<br>
            I first to Selred's court withdrew,<br>
            A single wish thy pow'r maintain'd,<br>
            A single wish thy son regain'd.<br>
            I left the maid whose matchless charms,<br>
            Each rooted prejudice disarms,<br>
            Who rul'd my heart with sovereign sway,<br>
            And taught a Mercian to obey<br>
            Laws that East-Saxons can impart,<br>
            When wit and beauty string the dart;<br>
            Left her when hope my doubts beguil'd,<br>
            And on our love her father smil'd.<br>
            Oft have I tried to win thine ear,<br>
            The fond, romantic tale to hear,<br>
            But when I found a lonely hour,<br>
            My coward soul has lost the pow'r;<br>
            As on my lips the accents hung,<br>
            Thy hate to Selred check'd my tongue.<br>
            Yet flattering hopes my passion fed,<br>
            And from thy court again I fled;<br>
            I thought when you my fair beheld,<br>
            And knew how greatly she excell'd,<br>
            In every charm, each art refin'd,<br>
            And virtue of the female mind,<br>
            Thy judgment would approve my choice,<br>
            And bless it with a cheerful voice.<br>
            And ah! though fortune did combine<br>
            With love, in making Ela mine,<br>
            I cannot from a grief refrain,<br>
            Remembering that I gave thee pain.<br>
            Yet if thy Cen'lin e'er could please,<br>
            If e'er my cares could give thee ease,<br>
            Let mild affection now arise,<br>
            And beam forgiveness from thine eyes!<br>
            No more thy son shall make thee know<br>
            A pain, or give thee cause of woe.<br>
            No nights the Mercians have to fear,<br>
            For all I love is center'd here,"<br>
            He spoke, and o'er his father's soul,<br>
            A stream of healing comfort stole;<br>
            He rose, with slow, majestic grace,<br>
            Tears of delight adorn'd his face,<br>
            His pious heart with rapture glow'd,<br>
            And joy a second youth bestow'd.

          </p>
          <p>
            "To meet thee thus, my son," he cried,<br>
            "This peerless maiden for your bride,<br>
            Bids each distressing thought depart,<br>
            And joy again possess my heart.<br>
            Fair princess, thine the happy fate,<br>
            To heal the wounds of mutual hate;<br>
            No longer shall this bosom know,<br>
            An Eastern-Saxon as my foe;<br>
            And she, who bids that passion rest,<br>
            Doubt not, shall be supremely blest;<br>
            The part is holy and benign,<br>
            Befitting such a form as thine.<br>
            This day, far dearer than before,<br>
            Kind heav'n does twice my son restore,<br>
            For by those speaking looks I see,<br>
            Another valued child in thee."

            &nbsp;

            As then he raised them to his breast,<br>
            Around the joyful Mercians prest,<br>
            And made their shouts of triumph rise,<br>
            To the fair concave of the skies.

            Lo! here a cloud comes sailing, richly clad<br>
            In royal purple, which the parting beams<br>
            Of bounteous Phoebus edge with tints of gold<br>
            And lucid crimson. One might fancy it<br>
            A noble bird, that laves its graceful form,<br>
            And bathes its rosy bosom in the light.<br>
            Look! how it swells and rears its snowy crest<br>
            With haughty grandeur; while the blue expanse,<br>
            In smiling patience lets the boaster pass,<br>
            And swell his train with all the lazy vapours<br>
            That hover in the air: an easy prey<br>
            To the gigantic phantom, whose curl'd wing,<br>
            Sweeps in these worthless triflers of the sky,<br>
            And wraps them in his bosom. Go, vain shadow!<br>
            Sick with the burthen of thy fancied greatness,<br>
            A breath of zephyr wafts thee into nothing,<br>
            Scatters thy spreading plumes, uncrowns thy front,<br>
            And drives thee downward to thy mother earth,<br>
            To mix with vapour and dissolve in dew.

            And nurtur'd by the smile of vanity,<br>
            Each hour the air-born vision gathers bulk,<br>
            And Fancy decks it with a thousand hues,<br>
            Varied and wild, till it abounds in charms<br>
            Which sink the soul to sadness, when the breath<br>
            Of gentle Reason breaks the beauteous bubble,<br>
            And leaves us nought but vain regret behind.

            The mantle, blue and gold, she wore,<br>

            Hail, melancholy sage! whose thoughtful eye,<br>
            Shrunk from the mere <i>spectator's</i> careless
            gaze,<br>
            And, in retirement sought the social smile,<br>
            The heart-endearing aspect, and the voice<br>
            Of soothing tenderness, which Friendship breathes,<br>
            And which sounds far more grateful to the ear,<br>
            Than the soft notes of distant flute at eve,<br>
            Stealing across the waters: Zimmermann!<br>
            Thou draw'st not Solitude as others do,<br>
            With folded arms, with pensive, nun-like air,<br>
            And tearful eye, averted from mankind.<br>
            No! warm, benign, and cheerful, she appears<br>
            The friend of Health, of Piety, and Peace;<br>
            The kind Samaritan that heals our woes,<br>
            The nurse of Science, and, of future fame<br>
            The gentle harbinger: her meek abode<br>
            Is that dear home, which still the virtuous heart,<br>
            E'en in the witching maze of Pleasure's dance,<br>
            In wild Ambition's dream, regards with love,<br>
            And hopes, with fond security, to pass<br>
            The evening of a long-protracted day,<br>
            Serenely joyful, there.

            Of selfish Sorrow smother up thy voice,<br>
            When it should speak of a departed friend.<br>
            A tender friend, the first I ever lost!<br>

            No keen regret laid pining at my heart,<br>
            Nor Memory in the solitary hour,<br>

            Thy virtue, knowledge, wisdom, gentleness,<br>

            Thought nobler of itself, that one so good,<br>
            So honor'd, so rever'd, should give it me.<br>
            O <i>Isola!</i> when that glad season comes,<br>
            Which brought redemption to a ruin'd world,<br>
            And, like thee, hides beneath the snow of age,<br>
            A gay, benevolent, and feeling heart,<br>
            I hop'd again to hear thy tongue repeat,<br>
            With youthful warmth and zealous energy,<br>
            Those passages, where Poetry assumes<br>
            An air divine, and wakes th' attentive soul<br>
            To holy rapture! Then you promis'd me<br>

            Once rear'd its turrets in the air.<br>
            There infant warriors drew their breath,<br>
            And learn'd to scorn the fear of death.<br>
            In halls where martial trophies hung,<br>
            They listen'd while the minstrels sung,<br>
            Of pain and glory, toil and care,<br>
            And all the horrid charms of war:<br>
            There caught the fond desire of fame,<br>
            And panted for a hero's name.<br>
            Alas! too oft in youthful bloom,<br>
            Renown has crown'd the early tomb,<br>
            Has pierc'd the widow's bosom deep,<br>
            And taught the mother's eyes to weep.<br>
            She, on whose tale the stripling hung,<br>
            While pride and sorrow rul'd her tongue.<br>
            His father's gallant acts to tell,<br>
            How bold he fought, how bravely fell.

            And the high-arching eye below.<br>
            The stifled sigh and anxious heave,<br>
            The kindling heart which dares not grieve;<br>
            The finely-elevated head,<br>
            The hand upon the bosom spread,<br>
            Proclaim him wrought by potent charms,<br>

            The loss of him who lives no more,<br>
            Ambition wakes her restless fire,<br>
            The boy will emulate his sire,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
